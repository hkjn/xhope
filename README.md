# xhope

Repo xhope holds the source code the xhope.tech website.

> There are a thousand for every one person hacking away at the root account of the universe â€” Unknown

## Concept

- A [2015 report by FHI](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Existential-risk-and-existential-hope.pdf)
  introduces "existential risk" and "existential hope", but the xrisk
  concept has gotten much more attention
- While it would be good to not lose everything we value in the
  universe (lower xrisk) it would also be good to increase the chance
  of unlocking very high amount of things which we do value (xhope)
- This site aims to describe promising technologies that could create
  xhope

## Ideas

- When typing 'existential hope' into Google, it auto-completes to
  'existential hopelessness'. How could we change this?
- The [Starshot
  project](http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/04/yuri-milner-zuckerberg-starshot-interstellar-centauri/477669/)
  was the motiation for creating this website
- Metaphor of planet Earth as a computer, life as information content
  periodically lost in mass extinction events / hard drive
  crashes. Shouldn't we have some backups?
- "Let's assume for a moment that sending a tiny probe to Alpha
  Centauri on light beams works. If that is feasible, then could we,
  in a few years when nanofabrication is more mature, send tiny
  nanofabricators to the stars the same way? And if that works, could
  we build a receiver on the other end that could reconstitute a mind
  uploaded person through whole brain emulation? Steps #1, #2, #3 to
  space-faring species. Seems more efficient and therefore more likely
  than Star Trekking." -- Randal Koene [https://www.facebook.com/randal.a.koene/posts/10153428461601175]
